# create and return a two-dimensional list

# grades are contained in a list. Write a function called dict_maker(data)
# to do this. Documentation below.

# dict_maker(data) -> dictionary
# data - two-dimensional list
# Description: This function accepts a two-dimensional list called data.
# It ignores the first list in data, which contains the header. Then it
# creates a dictionary bylooping through the list. The keys in the dict-
# ionary are the first items in each list, and the values for those keys
# are the exam grades stored as a list

# but where the values are the average of the exam grades. Note: some students
# have 'a' for absent in their exam grade list. Those should be ignored when
# calculating their exam average. Documentation is below:

# avg_dict_maker(d) -> dictionary
# d - dictionary 
# Description: This function accepts a dictionary called d where where the 
# keys are osis numbers and the values are lists of exam grades. A new dict-
# ionary will be created with the same keys as the given dictionary, but the
# values will be the average of the exam grades.

# a bar graph using the matplotlib submodule pyplot (aka plt). Documentation
# can be found below.

# vbar_graph_maker(d) -> None
# d - dictionary
# This function uses the submodule from matplotlib called pyplot to make
# a vertical bar graph based on the data found in the dictionary d. The keys
# of the dictionary will be the categories and the values of the dictionary
# will be the values of the horizontal bar graph.

# Let's go a step farther with the function we created in problem 4 called 
# avg_dict_maker(d). Create a new function called new_avg_dict_maker(d, option)
# that accepts a dictionary called d and an integer called option.
# Based on the option value, the function will calculate average where the 'a'
# values count as 55 (option=1), where the average is calculated after dropping
# the lowest score (option=2), or where both of these are the case and 'a' are
# counted as 55 and the lowest score is dropped (option=3). The function also
# creates a new hbar graph using the function from problem 5. Documentation below.

# new_avg_dict_maker(d, option) -> dictionary
# d - dictionary
# option - number
# This function has the same functionality as avg_dict_maker(d) except that
# there are additional options:
# 0 - works exactly the same as avg_dict_maker(d)
# 1 - counts all 'a' values as 55 when calculating average
# 2 - calculates average after dropping the lowest score
# 3 - counts all 'a' values as 55 and drops the lowest score&
